      Romil, the visionary founder of Romil Airlines, hails from the <br/>
      bustling oil sands city of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Growing up <br/>
      under the wide, open skies of Northern Alberta instilled in him <br/>
      a lifelong fascination with aviation. After completing his <br/>
      studies in electrical engineering at the prestigious UBC, Romil embarked on a journey <br/>
      that would see him become a pioneer in the airline industry. His <br/>
      passion for connecting people and places led him to establish <br/>
      Romil Airlines, an endeavor that quickly grew into a symbol of <br/>
      innovation and excellence in air travel. Today, Romil resides in <br/>
      Calgary, a vibrant city known for its entrepreneurial spirit and<br/>
       stunning Rocky Mountain backdrop. From his Calgary base, he <br/>
       continues to lead Romil Airlines into new horizons, driven by <br/>
       a commitment to exceptional service and a more connected world.  <br/>
